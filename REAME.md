# Startpage - Retro OS Inspired Web Hub
## Overview

Startpage is a personal web application that serves as a daily productivity hub, designed with a retro operating system aesthetic. The project is built entirely using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with data stored via localStorage to allow customization and tracking of user activities without any backend. All windows are draggable and can be hidden or shown based on user interaction.

This project is a demonstration of my front-end skills using core web technologies, specifically DOM manipulation and localStorage. It showcases a practical yet creative application that enhances daily productivity.

## Features

    Pomodoro Timer: A functional timer for productivity, helping to manage work and break periods.
    To-Do List: Track your daily tasks with an easy-to-use interface.

## Technology Stack

    JavaScript: Core functionality, including DOM manipulation and interactivity.
    HTML & CSS: Structure and styling, with a strong focus on retro-themed design.
    localStorage: Used for storing and retrieving data (e.g., user preferences, tasks, and progress).

## Future Plans (Version 2.0)

In the next version of Startpage, I plan to upgrade the project with:

    A backend using Node.js and PostgreSQL for data storage.
    Front-end rebuilt with React or a modern framework (still deciding between Vite, Astro, or Next.js).
    More advanced features and user customizations.

##Installation and Usage

Since this is a no-build web application, there is no need for any installation steps. You can clone the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser.

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/startpage.git

Open index.html directly in your browser.
Demonstration of Skills

## This project demonstrates my ability to work with:

    Vanilla JavaScript: DOM manipulation and event handling.
    CSS: Creating a visually appealing and functional interface.
    localStorage: Managing user data and preferences on the client side.

The simplicity of the tech stack is intended to showcase the power of fundamental web technologies. It's a perfect example of how creative ideas can be implemented without relying on frameworks or build tools.
